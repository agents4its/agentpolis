# AgentPolis

AgentPolis is a fully agent-based platform for modeling multi-modal transportation systems. It comprises a high-performance discrete-event simulation core, a cohesive set of high-level abstractions for building extensible agent-based models and a library of predefined components frequently used in transportation and mobility models. Together with a suite of supporting tools, AgentPolis enables rapid prototyping and execution of data-driven simulations of a wide range of mobility and transportation phenomena. We illustrate the capabilities of the platform on a model of fare inspection in public transportation networks.
